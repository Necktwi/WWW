   <h1>A detour to Swift</h1>
   <p>
   I am a C++ programmer. I love it. But I can't create variables, new 
   functions; change a program's behaviour at runtime. Let's say I am playing
   NFS most wanted, how about pausing the game, open a terminal, access the 
   variables of the game, change the speed variable of the car, add some cars 
   into world, hook up some new features to my car and resume the game. It 
   may not be appropriate for a game but it will be very handy to monitor a
   web server or an AI service; to input some right feedback. Using a C++
   debugger, given the debug symbols of the program, may be I can access the
   variables. I am not that expert. I've never got into the source code of 
   GNU compiler. But from my gut I can say that one can interpret each line 
   of code on fly and once enough number of lines piled up, they can be 
   compiled into an efficient C++ program.
   </p>
   <p>
   Swift is both an interpreter and a compiler! I think my wish has come true
   but I don't know how the Swift compiler works though it's source code is 
   on github. I hope I contribute to it someday. But I am skeptical about its
   speed. I have taken a detour to Swift from my regular C++ programming to 
   evaluate it's speed. I have put the two C++ and Swift comparision projects
   on github.

   Any issue with the code, please raise an issue. I shall keep adding more test
   cases.
